===============================================================================

This file describes the changes done to wpa_supplicant by Intel Corporation 
to support Wi-Fi Simple Configuration Reference Implementation. The 
original version of wpa_supplicant used is 0.4.8 as in 
wpa_supplicant-0.4.8.tar.gz.

Modified Files
==============

eap_defs.h - Added a new EAP type EAP_TYPE_WSC
eap.c - Added a new EAP method eap_method_wsc
defconfig - Added a new configuration option CONFIG_EAP_WSC
Makefile - Added new files to compile and link
wpa_supplicant.c - Added init and deinit of wsc_ie
wpa_supplicant_i.h - Added new functions to call into madwifi driver
driver.h - Added new function pointers to call into madwifi driver
driver_madwifi.c - Added code for setting and processing new WSC IEs

New Files
=========

eap_wsc.c - Implements WSC EAP method
eap_wsc.h - WSC EAP method header file
wsc_ie.c - Mechanism to set and process new WSC IEs
wsc_ie.h - Data structures for new WSC IEs 
UdpLib.c - Implements transport of messages between wpa_supplicant and upper layer
UdpLib.h - Transport header file

Additional building instructions
================================
To enable new WSC IE functionality (which works only with an updated MadWiFi 
driver from Atheros) the CONFIG_WSC_IE flag must be uncommented.

Please make sure to update the madwifi path in defconfig file depending
on the location of madwifi driver code. defconfig file is copied/moved to
.config file before building.
