<p>The Shift-JIS codec provides conversion to and from Shift-JIS, an encoding of JIS X 0201 Latin, JIS X 0201 Kana and JIS X 0208.</p>
<p>The environment variable <tt>UNICODEMAP_JP</tt> can be used to fine-tune the codec. The <a href="codecs-jis.html">ISO 2022-JP (JIS) Text Codec</a> documentation describes how to use this variable.</p>
